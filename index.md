Welcome to the CS3043 group project site for *Ready Player One*!  
Scroll down to learn more about *Ready Player One* and its relation to computing technologies.

# Computing Technologies
## Existing
  - ### Virtual Reality
    - Virtual 3D interactive worlds already exist with the help of specialized I/O equipment and powerful computers,
    users wear headsets and use controllers to interact with the virtual world [1]. 
    ![[7]](assets/virtual_reality.jpg)
    
  - ### Facial Scanning
    - iPhone X implemented facial recognition and scanning, but the current technology is not as precise as in the movie. Current technology limitations include having a hard time differentiating children's faces and family members[2]. However this technology is improving fast using machine learning. 
    ![[8]](assets/facial_scanning.jpg)
  - ### Virtual Currency
    - Exists in many apps and games in the form of in-game currency and used for in-game purchases, directly connected to real world money, money is used to purchase the in-game currency through a store.
    - Due to the world-wide use of the in-game currency, the movie’s virtual currency could resemble today’s cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are based on block-chain technology and use cryptography to ensure fairness in the system[3]. Cryptocurrencies have a value in real world dollars, but most are not able to be converted directly.

  - ### VR MMO
    - Communities of VR users have been a phenomenon since 2017 as seen in games such as VRChat. VR communities are in their early stages but many players are joining them and creating their own persona online. VR MMOs are currently gated behind having a strong PC to play as they require a decent amount of processing power[4].

## Future
 - ### Complete VR Immersion
    - Complete VR Immersion is currently being researched and developed by many VR companies attempting to overcome the weaknesses of VR. Currently many forms of VR are extremely limiting in what the user can do based on current technology restraints, but many researchers are starting to look at ways to improve how current VR technology is used. Using newer ideas with exsisting technology, such as force extension, and object impersonation [5]. Force extension will allow users to interact with objects based on force of gesture, creating a more realistic environment and object impersonation allows for users to interact with specific objects in a cluttered space by dissociating user into other object frames.
    
 - ### Control Technology with Mind
    - There are currently prosthetics that can be controlled using signals from the brain, but the current state of the technology is far from the state of control in *Ready Player One*

## Emerging
 - ### Control Technology with Mind
    - Omni-Directional Treadmill
 - ### Virtual Reality Headset with Computing Power
    - Current VR technology uses headsets that connect to a desktop to process the VR
    - Other VR headsets allow for a phone to be used in a VR headset, but the computing power is limited and far weaker than shown in the movie
 - ### Emotion Detection
    - Microsoft has created an Emotion API to read emotion, but it is still in development
 - ### Haptic Feedback
    - Startup company HaptX has created a prototype that contains hundreds of pressurized pockets of air to simulate feeling in VR
 - ### Casual Drone Deliveries
    - Amazon is developing drone technology to be used for prime deliveries
    
## Impossible
 - ### Amount of Copyright Licenses Used to Create Worlds, Avatars, Items, etc.
 - ### Hyper-realistic 3D Memory Segments from Past Videos, Documents, etc.

# Topics Covered
## Networked Communications - Ch.3
In the world of Ready Player One, the OASIS is a virtual game world that the whole world is a part of. In the modern internet system, people shop, socialize, contribute and distribute content, access legal and illegal information, crowdsource information, learn new ideas, enter virtual worlds, and the list goes on and on. In the OASIS, most if not all of these activities exist and are available because of the seemingly ubiquitous internet in the movie and the MMORPG elements of the game. Because of this fact, the big issues of the internet that the current world has are also issue in the OASIS.

At the beginning of the movie, Wade Watts explains how much of the world lives life in the OASIS because of the lack of natural resources and bleakness of the real world. While not explicitly stated in the movie, internet addiction (or rather OASIS addiction since the internet seems to have been replaced by the OASIS) plagues many people in Ready Player One. While jobs still appear to exist outside the game world, the main characters seem to be constantly in the OASIS. IOI loyalty centers are indirect proof of the overspending of real money in the game world. People felt the need to invest so much of their money into a game that they ended up in debt. Watt’s aunt’s boyfriend also demonstrates a level of internet addiction in which he uses Watt’s aunt’s money to buy new I/O equipment for his game. Watt’s decision to close the OASIS for 2 days a week to cause more people to spend time in the real world further pushes the point that his world needs to live in the real word and not spend so much time in the virtual one. His decision is similar to South Korea’s internet policy. South Korea prohibits children under 16 from playing online games from 12AM to 6AM to stave off the wave of internet addiction among South Korean teenagers. 

The OASIS consists of players from around the world of varying ages, and the global audience that it hosts may bring up the issue of child censorship. In the movie, Watts’ friend Sho is an 11 year old boy who everyone assumes to be much older throughout the majority of the movie. At the beginning of the movie, Watts explains there are variety of activities to do in the OASIS, and he suggests that there are adult activities. On top of this, the amount of violence and almost unlimited creativity for both appropriate and inappropriate content in the game warrants a discussion on how much is too much for kids in the OASIS. Sho seems to be able to access everything that Watts’ crew can access. When the team enters into The Shining, while humorous, The Shining has many inappropriate scenes that Sho should not be seeing without parental consent. 

Identity theft across networked communications is discussed in the textbook and is surely relevant to Ready Player One. On a less serious note, Aech’s masculine build and voice is not representative of the woman behind the scenes. While not a direct issue regarding Aech and common in video games and social media, online predators and scams in the form of bots may conceal their identity behind a virtual face. On a serious note, Watts and his team hack into Sorrento’s game account to trick him into thinking he is outside of the game world. While Watts did not steal Sorrento’s money or did physical harm to Sorrento, Watts looked at Sorrento’s password and virtually held him at gunpoint demanding him to give information. The movie makes an obvious point about keeping passwords secure, but it also highlights how user login information for a complex world such as the OASIS could have significant repercussions on society. If one had Watts’ account information, Watts’ could lose access to his account, in-game money likely linked to real world money, and his identity as a player.

## Intellectual Property - Ch.4
By watching Ready Player One or even just the trailer, one might’ve seen a reference to a character in past or current pop culture. Assuming that the OASIS is under U.S copyright law, that copyrights last for 70 years after the author’s death, and that the OASIS is an entity in itself that is seperate from the works of others and has not bought out all of the existing game companies, in 2045, the OASIS would pay a significant amount of licensing fees for including different characters from other games in their own game. 

Due to the OASIS’ size and global popularity, one could assume that the OASIS has replaced the internet and is essentially a highly interactive virtual storage container used by everyone. In that case, the OASIS would be treated like Google in that it does not pay for people’s content inside the system but rather hosts everybody and provides an interactive framework. As a result, the OASIS would not pay as many licensing fees to use copyrighted and patented material. Also, since Aech makes equipment and sells it in the game world, one may lean more towards the OASIS being a replacement for the internet where sellers can sell whatever they want without paying extra fees.

Since the OASIS is so popular in world of Ready Player One, players’ reliance on IOI I/O is capitalism at work. While not discussed or explained in the movie, the OASIS or Gregarious games most likely tried to develop their own I/O equipment to lower cost of entry into the game but had to cease production when IOI produced better patented equipment and gained popularity. While this claim is simply speculation within the U.S intellectual property laws, it provides an explanation why the OASIS did not produce I/O devices.

At the end of the movie, Halliday suggests his avatar is a copy of his subconscious. Because of the lack of this technology, one may wonder how the 70 years after author’s death copyright law works when dealing with the subconscious of another person. Is the author still alive because he can produce? Or is the author simply dead?

## Information Property - Ch.5
Players preserve their identity in the OASIS by using aliases. Information only gets out if people reveal their identity. Wade reveals his real name putting him and his family in danger. Someone was tracked easily by first name without government resources.
## Privacy and the Government - Ch.6
This chapter is not relevant to the movie because the movie doesn’t focus or spend time on how the government works and its relation to OASIS.
## Computer and Network Security - Ch.7
The virtual currencies in the movie could be stolen if the server operating OASIS was attacked. A security flaw in OASIS log off protocol allowed for “hackers” to prevent users from logging off. OASIS only uses 1 factor authentication allowing for susceptibility and account loss.

# Plot Time Line
### Pre-2040 
The world is in shambles due to the depletion of fossil fuels, global warming, and rampant overpopulation. In response, the world seeks escape from the real world by traveling to the OASIS, a Massively Multiplayer Online Simulation Game (MMOSG), created by James Halliday and Ogden Marrow of Gregarious Games. To enter the OASIS, players must acquire an omni-directional treadmill, haptic feedback body gear, and a virtual reality headset. While these items in today’s world are extremely expensive or still in development, in the world of Ready Player One, these items cost supposedly the equivalent of a U.S. quarter to lower the cost of entry. But there’s a catch. Like many current free-to-play games such as FortNite, the OASIS uses in-game transactions that require real world money. Even though the production of the OASIS costed hundreds of millions of dollars and took a decade to make, the money generated from in-game transactions quickly made Halliday and Marrow the 2 wealthiest men in the world.
### 2040   
James Halliday, co-creator of the OASIS passes away. After his death, Halliday’s in-game avatar Anaorak announces a quest to find the Golden Easter Egg by acquiring 3 hidden keys spread throughout the OASIS universe. Once a player obtains the Golden Easter Egg, the player will be given ownership of the OASIS. OASIS players and Innovative Online Industries (IOI), a powerful technology corporation, rush to find the keys to obtain control of the OASIS. IOI not only has hundreds of company players in search of the egg, but the company also controls a vast number of the in-game vendors and the production of OASIS haptic feedback gear. On top of this, IOI uses drone technology to obtain a tactical view of the real world for their various purposes involving package delivery, debt collection, and murder. In regards to debt collection, IOI operates “Loyalty Centers” which essentially force debtors to work off their debt in the OASIS under IOI supervision.
### 2045
Orphaned teenager Wade Watts, also known as Parzival in the OASIS, befriends Art3mis, a well-known Gunter (short for egg hunter), and they explore the Archives to find out information about Halliday’s life in the hope of finding the first key. The Archives has a collection of hyper-realistic reenactments of Halliday’s life which allows Watts to find specific details on Halliday’s life.

By driving backwards in the ever-shifting Manhattan cityscape racing mini game, Wade Watts and his friends obtain the first key. His crew becomes known as the High Fivers and consists of Parival, Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Sho.
After learning of Halliday’s several regrets in life including his love for his friend Marrow’s wife Kira, Watts and his crew travel to a recreation of the movie The Shining and find the second key. The recreation of pop culture references in a virtual reality format allows Watts and his friends to experience entertainment in ways that resemble real life. It is one thing to experience a jump scare, but it is another thing entirely when you are running away from the creature that jumped at you. On top of that, the player haptic feedback systems create an even more immersive experience where pain in a video game or movie may mimic real life pain.

Nolan Sorrento, CEO of IOI, hires an in-game mercenary i-R0k to find the identity of Watts and offers Watts an important job at IOI. When Watts refuses the position, Sorrento bombs Watts home, killing Watts’ aunt. Art3mis, in real life, saves Watts, but is captured soon after by IOI and put into a servitude chamber. The fact that Sorrento hires an in-game mercenary to find information on Watts’ points to the reality of online privacy. While a game may have good intentions of providing an entertaining experience, the more a game or software becomes popular and integrated with real life, the more privacy becomes a real issue. As seen in the movie, the real-life information leaked by Watts costs him his aunt’s life and the destruction of his home.

IOI discovers that the final key is found playing Halliday’s favorite Atari 2600 game on Planet Doom. In an effort to stop anyone from disrupting their operations, IOI protects the location with a force field. To stop IOI from obtaining the final key, Watts and his crew free Art3mis from the IOI facility and recruit OASIS players to fight against IOI. To free Art3mis from IOI, Watts and his friends trick Sorrento into thinking he’s being held hostage by hacking into his account. Because Sorrento left his account password on a piece of paper on his arm rest, the team creates a simulation within the OASIS. When Sorrento logs out of the OASIS, he thinks he’s back in the real world. In reality, however, he’s in a recreation of his office. The hyper realism of virtual reality is to be noted because it convinced Sorrento he was in the real world. But what is more important and relevant to today’s digital age crawling with cyber crime is the issue of security. By hacking into a person’s OASIS account, one could effectively convince a person that they were living normal life and the victim would be none the wiser. Sorrento’s ignorance to keep a physical copy of his password nearby reminds the movie viewer of the value of online passwords.

Art3mis deactivates the force field and as a last line of defense Sorrento activates a virtual bomb that kills all player avatars on Planet Doom. Because of a special coin that Watts obtained from the Archive Collector who is secretly Morrow’s avatar, Watts regenerates, completes the final challenge, and is awarded the 3rd key. 

Watts is taken to a special virtual room and given a contract to sign by Anorak. The contract is exact same contract that Morrow signed to turn over his share of Gregarious games, and since Watts is aware of the contract’s significance, he refuses to sign the contract. As a result of Watts’ wise decision, Anorak transforms into James Halliday, and Halliday graciously gives Watts the Golden Easter Egg and control over the OASIS. Anorak also says during this time that he is not an NPC. This dialogue suggests that Anorak may be a copy of Halliday’s subconscious which begs the question if Halliday is internally still running the OASIS.

### Post-Egg
Sorrento is arrested for bombing Watts’ house and murdering his aunt. The government does not seem to be involved throughout much of the movie up until this scene which implies that the OASIS, an online video game, may have more of an influence on society than the US government.

Watts bans IOI from forcing people into servitude and shuts down the OASIS twice a week to encourage people to live life in the real world. Watts’ decision to shut down the OASIS reveals that he feels his world is addicted to the digital world. The power of a world with unlimited resources is attractive and some might say better than our current one. This debate continues to grow more relevant as virtual reality becomes more affordable, VR I/O allows for realistic feedback, and applications become more and more like real life. 

Watts and Samantha Cook (Art3mis in real life) move in together.
